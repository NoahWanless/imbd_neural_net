################################### Project overivew: ###################################

This was a college project I did making a neural network to train on IMBD movie reviews classifing them as positive or negative
The entire model was made fully from scratch
This was done with colaboration with two classmates of mine: EQ and Kendahl Cameau at Whitworth University.

This model was not sucessful because i had not realized that you cant assgin simple integer values to a word and then run that through a neural network.
This lead to a model that 'worked' but was as accurate as a random guess.
So while in the end this project was a failure, i learned a lot about making neural nets, the math behined it along with the implenmation of it and some 
of the tricker points gradient descent. And finally introduced me to the idea of vectorization of words as a method to imbed words.

if you want more documentaion go to the documentaion.md file

IMPORTANT NOTE: The program currently doesnt run due to a module being outdated, I havent had the time to fix this, but im not sure if i will because
the project was not successful to begin with.
